/**
 * @class Effector
 * @brief Base class for all effectors.
 * @ingroup effectors
 *
 * Effectors are used by agents to manipulate the environemnt.
 * This class serves as a base class for all effectors, providing a generic interface (via the @ref GetActionObject() and @ref Realize() methods) for performing action commands received from agents.
 * The action command from an agent is proivided as @ref Predicate.
 * The @ref GetActionObject() method is used to check and convert the @ref Predicate into an effector specific @ref ActionObject.
 * This @ref ActionObject is then forwarded to the @ref Realize() method and buffered in @ref #mAction for later application.
 * The actual application / realization of the action in the next simulation cycle then typically happens in the @ref PrePhysicsUpdateInternal() method, which uses the buffered action to manipulate the state of the physical simulation accordingly.
 *
 * @todo Document relation of effectors to scene graph.
 *
 * Effectors in general can be enabled or disabled.
 * Only the actions of enabled effectors are actually applied in the next simulation cycle.
 * If an effector is disabled, it has no effect on the next simulation cycle.
 * The @ref Enable() and @ref Disable() methods are used to control the activation state of effectors.
