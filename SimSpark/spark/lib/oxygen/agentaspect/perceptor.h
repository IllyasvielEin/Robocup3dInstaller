 * Depending on the actual perceptor, sensor information might be available more or less frequent.
 * To address this issue, each perceptor provides its own perception interval in which new sensor information is generated.
 * The @ref GetInterval() and @ref SetInterval() methods are used to access and change the interval cycle of a perceptor.
