/*! @mainpage API Reference

SimSpark API reference documentation generated by Doxygen.

Below are some links to pages containing useful information regarding the actual implementation of rcssserver3D.

-   @subpage implementation "Implementation":
    This section gives an overview of how the source code distribution is structured.
    You should read it first.

-   @subpage howtos "HowTos":
    This is probably the most useful section as it describes how to go about using the framework developed to realize custom simulations.
    For example, how do you implement a class which can live in the object hierarchy (and make it loadable from the Ruby script side).
