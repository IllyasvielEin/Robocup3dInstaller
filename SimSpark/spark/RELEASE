[0.3.3]
Finally, a new release of simspark is here! I'm very happy to report that
agents are now allowed to connect / disconnect in the same simulation frame
without crashing the server. This change will speed up match setup drametically
and as a result improve various learning scenarios. In addition to that, Qt4 is
replaced with Qt5 and RUNPATH support was added.

 - Allow agents to connect / disconnect in the same simulation frame
  -- Agents are now spawned into a separate spawning area while avoiding
     collisions with already existing agents. The spawning area is specified by
     two points (SpawningAreaStart and SpawningAreaStop) in the corresponding
     ruby script.
 - Added RUNPATH support (replacing old RPATH logic)
  -- Added option to specify additional library / bundle locations for concrete
     simulations.
 - Default to C++17
 - Resolved some compiler warnings
 - Updated from Qt4 to Qt5
